The Speculative Sea Level Explorer App runs on OSX, Windows and Linux. You can download a zip-file which contains the plattform specific application e.g. "application.macosx.zip". Source code and the zip files are available on [github.com/b-g/Speculative-Sea-Level-Explorer](https://github.com/b-g/Speculative-Sea-Level-Explorer)

Inside the github repository there is a SRTM-file for central europe, see "data/w020n90.Bathymetry.srtm". Run the app and press the "Load SRTM File" button to load the SRTM-file  to get started. You can download other SRTM tiles for the rest of the world at the website of the [Scripps Institution Of Oceanography](http://topex.ucsd.edu/WWW_html/srtm30_plus.html). Please note, the SRTM files around the Antarctic currently don't work correctly.
